# Home-automation

We aim to develop the following systems:

1. Security System: This system grants access to the house through either a facial recognition or fingerprint sensor using third party apps available. In the event of a forced entry, an immediate notification will be sent to alert us. For a person to enter the house, his/her mobile phone must be authorized by a local hotspot by checking the IP address. Further he/she will be checked by biometrics(face detection) which opens the app.

2. Moisture Detection System: This system is designed to monitor the moisture level in the soil. If the moisture exceeds a predetermined threshold, it will automatically switch off the pump supplying water to the plants.

3. Automated Device Control System: This system detects and keeps track of the number of people present in a room. If the count decreases to zero, it will initiate the automatic shutdown of any electronic devices or appliances within the room.

4. Kitchen Alarm: This system functions as a reminder if a person has left the kitchen with food still cooking on the stove. After a specific time threshold, an alarm will be triggered to prompt the person to attend to the food.
